(1)'TGA' is a file of codes from the personal page of Marco Cuturi.
    These codes were used for the computation of triangular alignment kernel.
    
(2)'anova.py' is the code for SVC with  ANOVA kernel in the benchmark experiments 
   for dataset with time series in consistent lengths.
   
   'anova_Mutil.py' is the code for SVC with ANOVA kernel in the benchmark experiments 
   for dataset with time series in inconsistent lengths.

(3)'kernels.py' is a modified version of codes for SVC with Sequential kernel of the article 
   'Kernels for sequentially ordered data' written by F. J Kiraly and H. Oberhauser.

   'kernels.py' contains codes for SVC with the bag of features kernel, sequential kernel 
    and s-sequential kernel for time series in consistent length or inconsistent lengths.
   
   Note that: 'V' in the SeqKernelizer() and BagKernelizer() should be set to be 
                 (1)True, when time series have inconsistent lengths
                 (2)False, when time series have consistent lengths
              
              'Dia=True' when one want to use the simple version of s-sequential kernel proposed in the Thesis.
